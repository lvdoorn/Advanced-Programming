\section{How to Run the Code}
Our \texttt{src} folder contains 2 files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{twitbook.pl} where the main implementation of the required predicates are situated;
	\item \texttt{tests.pl} with all unit tests for predicates in \texttt{twitbook.pl}.  
\end{itemize} 
We run our tests by \texttt{'swipl -f tests.pl -t run\_tests'} command in the root folder.
If we want to run some specific tests or check manually predicates, we run \texttt{'swipl tests.pl'}. This is possible because \texttt{tests.pl} file contains a reference to \texttt{twitbook.pl} file.

\section{Implementation Details}
Unfortunately, we have not been able to get all predicates working. All predicates from level 1 work, and from level 2 \texttt{admires/3} works, but \texttt{indifferent/3} and \texttt{same\_world/3} do not work. We have tried to implement \texttt{indifferent/3}, but get in a situation where either edge cases do not work, or infinite true answers are returned. 

\section{Assessment of Implementation}
From our test cases and onlineTA we are pretty confident that the predicates from level 1 and \texttt{admires/3} work correctly. We have written our own test cases and see that onlineTA generates many random graphs on which it is tested.
