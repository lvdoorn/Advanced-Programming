\section{How to Run the Code}


\section{Implementation Details}
Unfortunately, we have not been able to get all predicates working. All predicates from level 1 work, and from level 2 \texttt{admires/3} works, but \texttt{indifferent/3} and \texttt{same\_world/3} do not work. We have tried to implement \texttt{indifferent/3}, but get in a situation where either edge cases do not work, or infinite true answers are returned. 

\section{Assessment of Implementation}
From our test cases and onlineTA we are pretty confident that the predicates from level 1 and \texttt{admires/3} work correctly. We have written our own test cases and see that onlineTA generates many random graphs on which it is tested.
